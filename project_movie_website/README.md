<h1>Movie Faves</h1>
 <p>Hello and welcome to the infamous Movie Faves website generator, courtesy of Udacity
 and me, Luke Buthman!</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
 <p>Creating spiffy movie websites is easy. To get started, check out the dependencies
 section below, install those libraries and then open the python file called
 entertainment_center.py. If you aren't sure how to open a Python file, 
 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1522564/how-do-i-run-a-python-program">learn how here.</a></p>
 
 <p>After the program is opened, it will ask you to input your favorite movies. Simply
 type in each movie title, careful to be specific and use proper spelling (or you might
 find a new favorite movie by accident hehe). When you are done and ready to make your 
 website, simply type q or quit. Your html website will then be kneaded, tossed, baked, 
 and ready in no time. Have fun! Impress your friends! Rule the world!</p>

<h3>Required dependencies</h3>
This project uses some external wrappers (fancy word for python applications), and you
will need these bad boys to get started. They are easy to download and the links can
be found below.<br/><br/>

&nbsp;* <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/clint/">clint</a>

<h3>Make it your own!</h3>

Generating your favorite movies is just the beginning. Now that you have
successfully created your html website, feel free to customize it.

For instance you can change the title, change the styling, put a goofy
picture of yourself, the sky is the limit!
